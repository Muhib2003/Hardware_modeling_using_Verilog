# Hardware Modeling Using Verilog

A Verilog-based implementation of digital logic and sequential circuits — from elementary gates to arithmetic units — designed for learning, simulation, and hardware design using ModelSim.

📘 Overview

This repository contains Verilog implementations of various digital logic components and subsystems, covering both combinational and sequential designs.
Each module includes a testbench for functional verification.

Implemented Modules

🧱 Elementary Gates: AND, OR, NOT, Full Adder.

🔀 Multiplexer / Demultiplexer: 2-to-1, 4-to-1 MUX and DEMUX.

➕ Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Addition, subtraction, logic operations, etc.

⏱️ Sequential Circuits: Flip-flops,shift  Registers, Counters, and more.

🧪 Simulation Tools: Modelsim


🎯 Purpose

This project helps learners understand how digital systems are modeled, tested, and simulated using Verilog HDL.
It provides a strong foundation for those exploring Digital Logic Design, HDL Modeling, and VLSI Fundamentals.
