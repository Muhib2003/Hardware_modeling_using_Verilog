# Hardware Modeling Using Verilog

A Verilog-based implementation of digital logic and sequential circuits — from elementary gates up to arithmetic units — useful for learning, simulation, and hardware design.


## Overview

This repository contains Verilog implementations of a variety of digital logic components and small subsystems, including:

- Elementary gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.)  
- Multiplexers / Demultiplexers  
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and other arithmetic/logic circuits  
- Sequential logic circuits (flip-flops, registers, etc.)  



## Features / Modules

Some of the key modules included:

- **Elementary Gates** — Basic building blocks (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, etc.)  
- **Multiplexer / Demultiplexer** — e.g. 2-to-1, 4-to-1 mux, and corresponding demux  
- **Arithmetic / Logic Units** — Modules to perform addition, subtraction, logic operations, etc.  
- **Sequential Logic** — Flip-flops, registers, counters.
