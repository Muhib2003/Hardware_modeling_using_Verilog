# SISO4 Sequential Circuit

This project implements a 4-bit Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) shift register using Verilog.

## Overview
The SISO4 shift register is a fundamental sequential circuit used for temporary data storage and transfer in digital systems. It accepts serial data input, shifts the data through four flip-flops on each clock pulse, and outputs the data serially. This design is useful for applications requiring data serialization, timing adjustments, or simple data buffering. The Verilog implementation provides a clear example of synchronous sequential logic with reset capability.


### Features
